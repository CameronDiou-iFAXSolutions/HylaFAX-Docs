By default, there are three DID groups configured. They are 1234 , 1321 , and 4321 . If a fax is sent to a non-existent DID group, then it will be stored in the \u201cCatch-All\u201d group. The admin account has access to view all faxes received in every DID group including the \u201cCatch-All\u201d group. The tech account only has access to view the faxes received on the 1321 and 4321 DID groups. The user account only has access to the 1234 DID group. Therefore, if you send a fax to 4321 , the users admin and tech will see the fax in the Inbox while user will not. If you send a fax to 2175 , only admin will be able to view the fax because it will be stored in the \u201cCatch-All\u201d group. You can create new DID groups and adjust user permissions in the Admin Settings area. Fax Dispatch If you'd like to perform an action (e.g. execute a script) when a fax is received, that can happen on in FaxDispatch FaxDispatch is sourced by bin/faxrcvd, which is executed by btgetty. Here are some things you can do with it: Email routing by CallerID, by DID, or by receiving device (example case statements for each type of routing are included). FaxDispatch sets the SENDTO variable in order to route faxes to emails. Similarly it sets FROMADDR. Sending the fax attachment as different types (i.e., TIFF instead of PDF) FaxDispatch sets the FILETYPE variable to pdf,tiff to manage this. Or to \"none\" to not attach anything at all. Or you can use TIFF instead of PDF for a specific destination, see below. Automatic printing Copying faxes to different directories (this is good for those who want backups or to send faxes to a different network share Adding faxes to the web interface. Set the TEMPLATE variable (or in FaxDispatch, add the variable, as it starts out not included in the file), to specify which email templates are used for notification Fax to Email using FaxDispatch By default your server will have the following examples in its FaxDispatch file. You can see examples of how to route your emails based on the Caller ID $CALLID1 or the DID Route $CALLID2 or the device the fax was recived on $DEVICE When using multiple analog lines, you can determine which port the fax number is connected to by running watch faxstat and then calling the fax numbers with your phone.

We recommend your systems pull from the HylaFAX server for an important reason: so that HylaFAX is guaranteed to be able to invoke all post-reception routines successfully, without reliance on external systems or file storage. HylaFAX's faxrcvd script only runs once, when the fax is received. If your remote filesystem was not mounted at the time it was run, the fax would fail to get copied over, and there would be no indication of any failure. So at least the very first copy HylaFAX does should be local. *Add link to Samba setup guide Using LDAP/AD Connection to LDAP server must be set up first! See guide below for instructions: *Create a link to the LDAP doc Route the fax to email based on the DID listed for users in LDAP (or Active Directory): LDAPEMAIL=`ldapsearch -LLL -x -D \"CN=Fax Server,OU=System Accounts,DC=Example,DC=com\" \\ -y /etc/ldap.secret \"facsimileTelephoneNumber=*$CALLID2\" mail | grep \"^mail:\" | \\ cut -f 2 -d ' ' | awk '{ str1=str1 $0 \",\" }END{ print str1 }'` if [ -n \"$LDAPEMAIL\" ]; then SENDTO=$LDAPEMAIL fi You must update the LDAP connection parameters (ie: LDAP host, BaseDN, etc) in the command above.

Priority Assign the specified scheduling priority to subsequent jobs. A priority is an integer value in the range [0-255]. Lower values result in higher priority processing. By default, each job is assigned 127 for an initial scheduling priority. If a job\u2019s priority is greater than bulk faxes then the job\u2019s priority is raised (numerically lowered) for each failed attempt to transmit so that retransmit attempts are done ahead of newly submitted jobs. In the case of bulk faxes (numerically higher than 190), then the job\u2019s priority is lowered (numerically raised) for each failed attempt to transmit so that the whole of the bulk-queued jobs will be attempted before any are retried. The priority may also be specified as one of the following symbolic names: default or normal (127), bulk or junk (191), low (190), or high (63). Compression -1 Ex: sendfax -1 ... Transmit facsimile documents using 1-D MH compression. By default HylaFAX will use the optimal compression scheme supported by the transmitting modem and receiving facsimile device. -2 Ex: sendfax -2 ... Transmit facsimile documents using 2-D MR compression, if possible.

Transmit facsimile documents using 2-D MMR compression, if possible. By default HylaFAX will use the optimal compression scheme supported by the transmitting modem and receiving facsimile device. Speed -b speed Ex: sendfax -b 14400 ... Transmit facsimile documents using a signalling rate that is constrained to be at least speed bits/second. If the specified speed is greater than the transmitting modem or receiver is capable of, it is reduced to the highest possible speed both devices support. If a negotiated signalling rate greater than or equal to speed cannot be negotiated then the job is aborted. Possible speeds are: 2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12000, 14400, 16800, 19200, 21600, 24000, 26400, 28800, 31200, and 33600.

Use specific modem -h modem@localhost Ex: sendfax -h boston00@localhost ... Tries and Max dials Create a page for deeper explination of both -t tries Ex: sendfax -t 6 ... Make no more than tries attempts to send the facsimile. (A try is a call in which carrier is established and the facsimile protocol is commenced; this is contrasted with a call attempt that might have failed because the line was busy.) Without specifying a \"tries\" value to the server Hyla FAX will, with some exceptions, make an unlimited number of attempts to completely send the facsimile before the kill time expires.

Use ''-1'' to indicate that no tries value should be specified to the server. -T maxdials Ex: sendfax -T 4 ... Make no more than maxdials calls in attempting to send the facsimile. By default, HylaFAX will redial 12 times before killing a job. Use ''-1'' to indicate that no maxdials value should be specified to the server. Custom Client Applications Should you desire to write your own client application for submitting faxes to HylaFAX, below are sample applications in .NET and Java: \u2022 .NET sample client http://people.ifax.com/~david/dotnetsample.zip \u2022 Java sample client http://people.ifax.com/~david/javasample.zip Web Interface add link to web interface doc Email-to-Fax Email to FAX is simply a matter of Postfix receiving an email and handing it off to the faxmail program. Postfix is the email server that receives the email, and faxmail is a program included with HylaFAX for processing email messages and submitting them to HylaFAX for faxing. In the \"Configuring Mail\" area of the HylaFAX Enterprise Appliance console, you can set up Email to FAX support. To configure Email to FAX support, enter the domain name that you intend to use into the \u201cFax Domain\u201d field (ie. fax.example.com) and save your changes. Keep in mind that your mail server must be able to lookup the Fax Domain in your network's DNS in order to deliver emails to the HylaFAX Enterprise server. Next, send the email by addressing the recipient using the \"FAXNUMBER@fax.example.com\" format where FAXNUMBER is the actual fax number. If the job was successfully added to the HylaFAX queue, you'll see it in the Outbox of web interface and in the output of \"faxstat -s\". Email-to-Fax tweaks: Increase postfix message size limit To review the current maximum message size limit, run: postconf message_size_limit To increase the max message size limit, run: postconf -e message_size_limit=20480000 postfix reload Multiple Fax Domains To set this up you will need to edit the postfix configration file main.cf located at /etc/postfix/ . At the bottom of this file is the variable relay_domains . Add your new domains to that variable separated by a comma. relay_domains= faxserver.example.com, faxserver.test.com, faxserver.ifax.com In the file virtual_alias-fax located at /etc/postfix/ , add a line at the bottom for each new domain in this style (this would be to add \"fax.newdomain.com\" as an email-to-FAX domain: /^([+]?[0-9*#.-]+)@fax\\.newdomain\\.com$/ $1@fax.localhost Finally reload the postfix configuration: postfix reload Ignore Email Body If you would like to ignore the email body of an Email to FAX message, execute the following command: ln -s /bin/true /usr/sbin/faxmail/text/plain That file tells faxmail to ignore \"text/plain\" email attachments, which is what the email body consists of. Simply delete /usr/sbin/faxmail/text/plain and faxmail will send the email body in addition to any other plain text files in the email to HylaFAX for faxing. Disable Email Headers Create /etc/hylafax/faxmail.conf with the following content to disable the email headers from appearing in the fax: AutoCoverPage: false TextPointSize: 12pt Headers: clear MailUser: faxmail TrimText: yes Disable Cover Pages Create /etc/hylafax/faxmail.conf with the following content to disable the email headers from appearing in the fax: AutoCoverPage: false TextPointSize: 12pt Headers: clear MailUser: faxmail TrimText: yes Modem Control Specifying Default Outbound Devices You can use the ModemReadyState parameter in the /var/spool/hylafax/etc/config.bostonXX files to control whether or not the device is assigned to outbound jobs. For example, if you want to dedicate boston00 to boston01 for receiving faxes only (thus allowing boston02-07 to both send and receive faxes), then you would add the following setting to files config.boston00 and config.boston01 : ModemReadyState: D That would tell HylaFAX not to use boston00 and boston01 for outbound jobs. For details, please see the hylafax-config manpage. Afterward, restart the affected btgettys so that they immediately reload their configuration: faxquit boston00; faxquit boston01 -or- for i in /var/spool/hylafax/FIFO.boston0[0-1]; do echo Q > $i; done Modem Order In /var/spool/hylafax/etc/config, you can use the \u201cany\u201d modem group to specify which modem devices to use. For example, to only use boston00 to boston07, use: ModemGroup: \u201cany:boston0[0-7]\" The field is a regular expression and can get as complicated as it needs to be. For example, to use boston00 through boston12, here's the regexp: \"any:boston(0[0-9]|1[0-2])\" No restarts are required to put this into effect. Additionally, you can tell the system in which order to use the devices. You can specify a modem priority for each channel by editing the /var/spool/hylafax/etc/config.bostonXX files and adding the ModemPriority parameter, which sets the scheduling priority to use for a modem. Priority values are in the range 0 to 255 with lesser values signifying higher (more desirable) priority. The HylaFAX scheduler process assigns the highest priority modem that is ready for use when scheduling an outbound job. If multiple available modems in a job's selected ModemGroup have the same ModemPriority value, then the HylaFAX scheduler assigns jobs to them in a round-robin fashion. For example, in config.boston22 add: ModemPriority: 0 And in config.boston00 add: ModemPriority: 23 And in files config.boston21 to config.boston01 complete the range of values. For example: config.boston21: ModemPriority: 1 config.boston20: ModemPriority: 2 config.boston19: ModemPriority: 3 ... config.boston02: ModemPriority: 21 config.boston01: ModemPriority: 22 Afterwards, restart the btgetty's so that they immediately reload their configuration. for i in /var/spool/hylafax/FIFO.boston0[0-1]; do echo Q > $i; done Pausing Modems Add the following to the bottom of /var/spool/hylafax/etc/config: ModemGroup: \"any:hold\" No restarts are required to put this into effect. (faxq rereads the etc/config file after receiving another event - such as a new job being created - so once the file is edited, no new jobs will be sent.) When all channels are \"Running and idle\u201d then the queue is officially paused. Then to un-pause the queue, comment out the ModemGroup line. At that point you can force faxq to reread the config file by running echo Z > /var/spool/hylafax/FIFO","title":"Sending Faxes"},{"location":"master/sending-faxes/#sending-faxes","text":"","title":"Sending Faxes"},{"location":"master/sending-faxes/#sendfax","text":"HylaFAX includes a command line program called sendfax for sending faxes.

That basically means that the remote side sent us a DCN (disconnect) signal unexpectedly. There are many reasons for which they may have done this, ranging from someone on the sending side asking their fax machine to abort the transmission, to more problematic situations like bad phone line condition. One should only worry about these if they\u2019re consistently failing with a specific fax number \u2014 in that case there may be a problem that bears further examination. But if only a small number of these are seen, and if the same fax number that failed a few minutes earlier reconnects and successfully transmits a fax, then they\u2019re not worth worrying about. Occasional failures are a fact of life, but systematic errors are worth investigating. \"Invalid dialing command\" errors? In most cases, \"Invalid dialing command\" means that the telephone company or PBX rejected our call as invalid, or played us a 'your call cannot be completed as dialed' recording. Check the number and try again. \"No loop current\" The \"No loop current\" error happens when the fax modem is expecting a normal fax transmission but the remote side of the call hangs up instead. Regarding inbound calls, this usually occurs when someone dials the fax server\u2019s number and hangs up once they hear fax tones. No carrier detected\" errors \"No carrier detected\" errors typically occur when the modem dials a number and establishes a connection but is unable to detect a \"fax carrier\" like a fax server or fax machine. In this case, the modem will eventually hang up and show the \"No carrier detected\" error. Should this happen, verify that the fax number is answered by a fax machine and not an answering machine or something else. \"BfvFaxEndOfDocument did not return in 600000ms\" errors The BfvFaxEndOfDocument error occurs when a timeout of 10 minutes has elapsed after the last page is sent and before the end of transmission. This can occur when sending complex pages at slow speeds and/or when there are multiple Partial Page Requests (PPR), but this shouldn\u2019t occur frequently. Blocked by Concurrent calls By default, HylaFAX will schedule a job immediately if a modem is available. However, if you\u2019re sending multiple fax jobs to the same destination, the first job will be sent out immediately while the second one waits for the transmission to complete. HylaFAX does this in order to avoid calling a fax machine that is known to be busy. If you know that specific destinations have multiple fax lines, you can use a JobControl script to dynamically configure the MaxConcurrentCalls setting for those destinations (thus allowing HylaFAX to place multiple simultaneous calls to those destinations). For details on MaxConcurrentCalls, please see the hylafax-config manpage. A sample JobControl script can be found here: http://people.ifax.com/~david/jobcontrol/jobcontrol-cid.sh limit all fax transmissions to 9,600 bit/s (V.29) Yes, edit /var/spool/hylafax/etc/CONFIG/boston and add the following parameter: BTWireModulation: V29 Afterwards, restart the 'btgetty' processes. Can I install VMware Tools? Yes, on CentOS 7, simply install the 'open-vm-tools' package. Why are we seeing \"SIP 488 Not Acceptable Here\" messages in our packet captures? We\u2019ve usually seen this for outbound calls when the remote side answers the call but takes longer than usual before sending fax tones. This can be caused by some sort of a device that answers the call in order to determine whether it is a fax call before transferring the call to a fax machine. Usually when there is a problem when this happens it\u2019s because the CED timeout to receive the T.38 re-INVITE has expired by the time the SIP gateway sends the T.38 re-INVITE. The SR140 will then send \"SIP 488 Not Acceptable Here\" and fallback to G.711 (if configured to do so) or end the call. To extend the CED timeout, add the following parameter to /var/spool/hylafax/etc/CONFIG/boston: BTCEDTimeout: 30 Afterwards, restart the btgetty processes. Brooktrout TR1034 how many rings will the HylaFAX server wait before timing out assuming there is no carrier on the other end? The length of time HylaFAX will wait to establish a conversation with the receiver when sending is controlled by the ced_timeout parameter. By default it\u2019s 40 seconds. To change that to 60, edit ifax/bt/config/btcall.cfg and change: ced_timeout 4000 to ced_timeout 6000 The value specifies the length of time, in 10 ms units, to wait for a fax answer tone (CED tone) from a remote fax machine.
